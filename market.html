            <article>
                <p>Electrical Engineers work across industries: power generation and distribution, consumer electronics, aerospace, automotive (EVs), telecommunications, and industrial automation. Demand is steady for engineers with hands-on design, embedded systems, and power electronics experience.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Median salary (US):</strong> Varies by role and experience; many sources cite a median between $80k–$110k, with higher pay in specialized fields (RF, power systems, or avionics).</li>
                    <li><strong>Growth areas:</strong> Electric vehicles, renewable energy (grid integration, inverters), embedded IoT, 5G/6G and RF, semiconductor design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hiring tips:</strong> Internships, practical projects (PCB/firmware), and experience with industry tools (SPICE, MATLAB, CAD) increase employability.</li>
